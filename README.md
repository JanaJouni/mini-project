# mini-project

This program was developed by Jana Jouni and Rokaya Al-Harakeh as a project for "mini-project" course under the supervision of doctor Mohammad Aoudi

In this project under the title "Hybrid AI-Powered Adaptive Quiz System" we designed and built an intelligent quiz platform using DeepSeek R1 AI engine, NLP-based question embeddings (Sentence-Transformers), and rule-based logic to dynamically adjust difficulty. Implemented with Python, Streamlit, and SQLite, the system features real-time personalization via ML clustering, secure authentication, and Docker deployment.
